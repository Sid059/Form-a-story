# Project Overview

Form a Story is an interactive web application that allows users to create customized versions of the classic "Tortoise and the Hare" fable by filling out a form with various inputs. The application dynamically generates a personalized story based on the user's selections. I built this project to demonstrate how web forms can dynamically generate creative content and to practice handling user input in web applications.

# Features
- Interactive Form: Collects user inputs including animals, adjectives, verbs, numbers, and more.
- Dynamic Story Generation: Real-time story customization based on user input.
- Story Comparison: Toggle between custom and original story versions.
- Form Validation: Ensures all required fields are completed.
- Smart Text Processing: Automatically capitalizes and cleans user inputs.
